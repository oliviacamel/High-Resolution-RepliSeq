# High Resolution Repli-seq
## overview
This directory contains codes used in [Zhao, Sasaki 2020](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-01983-8) for processing high resolution repli-seq data by constructing column-scaled, Gaussian smoothed Repli-Seq data arrays and replication feature extraction (initiation zones, timing transition zones, etc) from these arrays. 
## data
Here, I include high-res repli-seq data of 
- human embryonic stem cell lines H1 and H9
- human colon cancer cell line HCT116 
- mouse embryonic stem cell line F121-9 (*mus* x *cas* hybrid)
- mouse neural precursor cell differentiated from F121-9 (*mus* x *cas* hybrid)
