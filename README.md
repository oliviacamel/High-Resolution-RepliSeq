# High Resolution Repli-seq
## overview
This directory contains codes used in [Zhao, Sasaki 2020](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-01983-8) for processing high resolution repli-seq data by constructing column-scaled, Gaussian smoothed Repli-Seq data arrays and replication feature extraction (initiation zones, timing transition zones, etc) from these arrays.
